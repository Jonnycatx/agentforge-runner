What Needs to Happen (In Order)
Step 1: Build the Runner App First
Before users can download anything, someone needs to actually build the Tauri + Python app I outlined earlier.
Step 2: Create GitHub Repo & Release
github.com/agentforge/runner/├── releases/│   └── v1.0.0/│       ├── AgentForge-Runner.dmg      (macOS)│       ├── AgentForge-Runner.msi      (Windows)│       └── AgentForge-Runner.AppImage (Linux)
Step 3: Then the Download Link Works
Tell Replit This:
The Runner app needs to be built before we can offer downloads. Here's what to do:OPTION A: Build the Runner Now1. Create a new Tauri v2 project in this repo under /runner2. Follow the architecture I provided earlier (Tauri + Python sidecar)3. Build for macOS/Windows/Linux4. Create GitHub releases with the binaries5. Then the download link will workOPTION B: Update UI to "Coming Soon" (Temporary)Until the Runner is built, change the deployment modal to show:- "Native Desktop App - Coming Soon"- Keep the "Run in Browser" option as the primary/working option- Add "Build from Source" link to the runner code (for developers)For now, do OPTION B so users aren't confused by broken download links.Then we can work on OPTION A as a separate task.
Quick Fix for the UI
Ask Replit to update the deployment modal like this:
// Instead of a download link that doesn't work:<Button disabled className="opacity-50">  <Download className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />  Download for Mac  <Badge variant="outline" className="ml-2">Coming Soon</Badge></Button>// Show what DOES work:<Button onClick={runInBrowser}>  <Globe className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />  Run in Browser (Ready Now)</Button>
Summary
Question	Answer
Did Replit do something wrong?	No - they correctly identified the issue
Is the Runner built?	No - it's just planned, not created
Can users download it now?	No - the file doesn't exist
What should happen?	Build the Runner OR show "Coming Soon"
Want me to create the actual Runner app scaffold in your local repo so you have something real to deploy?
