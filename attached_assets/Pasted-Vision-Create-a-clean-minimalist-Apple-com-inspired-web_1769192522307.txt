Vision
Create a clean, minimalist, Apple.com-inspired web app called AgentForge that serves as a zero-central-cost portal for users to conversationally build, customize, and deploy AI agents. The platform itself hosts no models or inference – all compute happens via models that users connect themselves (via API keys, local Ollama instances, or shared community endpoints). This keeps hosting costs effectively zero (static hosting + minimal serverless backend). The experience must be "dummy-proof": users arrive, type a plain-English request like "I need an agent that can help migrate an old website to a new one", and a conversational builder agent guides them step-by-step to a fully configured, deployable agent.
Core Principles

Zero central hosting cost for inference: Never run models on central servers. All inference routes through user-provided model endpoints (OpenAI/Anthropic/Groq/Claude/Grok API keys, local Ollama/LM Studio, Hugging Face Inference endpoints, or community-shared public endpoints).
Apple.com aesthetic: Clean whitespace, high-quality typography (system fonts or Inter/San Francisco), subtle animations, hero sections with bold messaging, no clutter.
Cursor/Replit-inspired workflow: Conversational agent composer + live code preview/editor + one-click "Run" that executes using the user's chosen model.
Maximum user-friendliness: No coding required for 90% of use cases. Natural language → guided conversation → auto-generated agent config/code.

High-Level Architecture
Frontend (90% of the app)

Single-page application (SPA) built with Next.js 14+ (App Router) hosted on Vercel (free tier sufficient – static + edge functions).
State management: Zustand or Jotai (lightweight).
UI library: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components (customized for Apple-like minimalism).
Real-time chat/editor: Use Tiptap or CodeMirror for the code preview pane, split-view like Cursor (chat on left, code preview on right).
Authentication: Clerk or Supabase Auth (free tier) – email magic link or OAuth (Google/GitHub).

Backend (minimal, serverless)

Supabase (free/postgres tier) or Firebase for:
User accounts
Storing agent configs (JSON/YAML, not code execution)
Public agent gallery (community-shared agents)
Rate-limiting abuse

All inference calls happen client-side via the browser (fetch to user-provided endpoints/API keys stored encrypted in browser localStorage or Supabase edge functions).
No central GPU/compute – if a user wants to use a local model (Ollama), provide a small browser extension or desktop bridge (Electron app as optional companion).

Model Integration Strategy (The "zero-cost" key)

Users connect their own model providers → inference billed to them or run locally.
Pre-configured providers (one-click setup):
OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
Groq (Llama 3.1 70B/405B)
Google Gemini
xAI Grok
Local: Ollama (detect running instance via localhost:11434 health check)
Community: Public Hugging Face Inference API endpoints or shared Ollama public relays (if any exist)

Custom option: "Add any model" → user pastes base URL + API key format (supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints like vLLM, LM Studio, Text Generation WebUI).
Model selector UI: Dropdown like Cursor's model picker – shows cost estimates, speed, context length.

Key Pages & User Flows

Landing / Hero Page (apple.com style)
Full-screen hero with tagline: "Build powerful AI agents with natural language. No code required."
Subheadline: "Powered by your models. Zero platform fees."
Animated screenshots or short video loop of the conversational builder.
CTA: "Start building for free" → opens the Builder without login (guest mode, saves locally).

Agent Builder Dashboard (main workspace, like Cursor composer)
Split view:
Left: Chat interface with the Builder Agent (a system-prompted instance of the user's chosen model).
Right: Live preview of generated agent code/config + test chat pane.

Default Builder Agent prompt (hardcoded, refined iteratively):textYou are AgentForge Builder, an expert AI agent architect. Guide the user conversationally to define their agent's goal, personality, tools, knowledge, and model. Ask clarifying questions one at a time. When ready, generate clean, modular agent code (LangChain/LlamaIndex style) that the user can run or export. Never assume – always confirm.
Example flow (exactly as user described):
User: "I need to build an assistant."
Builder: "Great! What kind of agent do you need? (e.g., web design, data analysis, personal assistant)"
User: "I need an agent experienced in web design."
Builder: "Perfect. I'll build a high-end web design agent with tools for HTML/CSS/JS generation, image analysis, Figma import, etc. What is the main task or goal for this agent?"
User: "Migrate and update data from an old website to a new one."
Builder continues clarifying → selects appropriate tools → generates code.


Model/Agent Panel
Sidebar or top-bar selector like Cursor.
"Choose model for Builder" and "Choose model for your new Agent".
Pre-configured list + "Add custom" button.
For the final agent: User can choose different model than the builder (e.g., build with Claude, run with Groq).

Agent Gallery / Community
Public page of user-shared agents (opt-in share).
Fork/remix like Replit.
Run any public agent instantly using your own connected model.

Export & Run
One-click export: Download as ZIP (LangChain/LlamaIndex Python project), or run in-browser sandbox (using WebAssembly Pyodide for simple agents).
"Deploy" options: Generate Vercel/Netlify template, or Docker for local/Ollama.

Development Phases & Team Assignments
Phase 1 (2-3 weeks) – MVP Core

Designers (2): Wireframes + full UI kit (Apple-inspired). Hero, builder split-view, model selector.
Frontend devs (3): Next.js scaffold, auth, landing page, basic chat interface.
Full-stack dev (1): Supabase setup, agent config storage.

Phase 2 (3-4 weeks) – Conversational Builder

Backend/AI dev (2): Refine builder system prompt, implement client-side inference routing.
Frontend devs: Live code preview, model picker with pre-configured + custom.
Test rigorously with real user scenarios (web design migration, coding helper, research agent).

Phase 3 (2-3 weeks) – Polish & Community

Add agent gallery, sharing, forking.
Mobile-responsive (PWA).
Onboarding tour + example templates.

Phase 4 – Launch & Iterate

Analytics (PostHog self-hosted).
Feedback form directly in builder chat.

Risks & Mitigations

API key security: Never send keys server-side; store only in browser. Warn users clearly.
Rate limiting: Client-side only, plus Supabase row limits.
Abuse: Basic profanity/filtering + report button.
