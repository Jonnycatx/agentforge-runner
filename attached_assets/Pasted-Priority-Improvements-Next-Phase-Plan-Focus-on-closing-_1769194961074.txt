Priority Improvements & Next Phase Plan
Focus on closing the dummy-proof usage gap first — users must go from build → desktop chat avatar seamlessly. Then add fun/virality.
Phase 1: Real Inference + Persistence (2-3 weeks) – Make It Actually Work

Switch from demo simulation to real client-side inference:
In ChatInterface & AgentTestPane: Use fetch() directly to user-selected provider endpoints (OpenAI-compatible).
Support Ollama auto-detect (health check localhost:11434).
Fallback graceful banner: "Connect a model for real responses".

Add authentication & persistent storage:
Integrate Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Storage) — free tier.
Migrate MemStorage → Supabase tables (users, agents, public gallery).
Auto-sync agents across devices.

Enhance ModelSelector:
Custom "Add any endpoint".
Badges: "Local & Free" for Ollama.
Secure key storage (browser + Supabase edge functions if needed).


Phase 2: Desktop Runner App (4-5 weeks) – The Magic Moment

Build AgentForge Runner with Tauri:
Cross-platform (Win/Mac/Linux, ~10MB).
File association: Double-click .agentforge → opens avatar chat.
System tray + floating draggable avatar widget.
Global hotkey (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + A) → chat window.
Multi-agent support, avatar animations (thinking/idle/happy).
First-run 3-step guide + auto-Ollama install prompt.

New export format:
Primary: ".agentforge" JSON bundle (config + prompt + avatar).
Keep Python zip as advanced option.

Mobile: Add PWA install prompt + basic Capacitor wrapper for iOS/Android sync.

Phase 3: Fun, Virality & Polish (3-4 weeks)

Avatar system: Picker in Builder + customization ("wise owl with hat").
Voice mode: Web Speech API (input/output) in web + native in Runner.
Delight: Confetti on complete, smooth animations, achievement badges.
Virality:
One-click share links (public demo with rate-limited fallback).
Social share buttons + referral system.
Embeddable chat widgets.

Onboarding tour: Interactive (Shepherd.js) with video embeds.
Community upgrades: Ratings, reviews, weekly featured, contests
