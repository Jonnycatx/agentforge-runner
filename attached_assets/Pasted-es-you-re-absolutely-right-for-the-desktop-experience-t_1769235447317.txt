es, you're absolutely right — for the desktop experience to feel truly dummy-proof and magical (a native-looking window with avatar + chat prompt that "just opens" after download), users need a one-time download and install of the AgentForge Runner app. After that, every agent they build can be downloaded as a tiny config file that auto-opens in the Runner with zero extra steps.
This keeps the process simple:

One-time Runner install (~15-25 MB, cross-platform).
Then, every agent = tiny file download → double-click → instant chat window with avatar.

Here's how to make this seamless in the builder window (the main /builder page in your web app), so users see clear, low-friction options without confusion.
Recommended UI in the Builder Window (After "Complete" Step)
When the builder reaches "complete" (agent ready), replace the current deployment modal or add a prominent success banner + big buttons right in the builder interface (right pane or centered overlay). Make it feel celebratory and guiding.
Visual Layout Suggestion (in the right preview pane or modal):

Confetti / Success Animation (Framer Motion)
Brief burst + text:
"Your Agent is Ready!"
Primary CTA – Biggest & Most Prominent Button"Download & Run on Desktop (Easiest)"
Large blue button (Apple-style rounded, bold text)
Subtext: "One-time install of AgentForge Runner (recommended – no Terminal needed)"
On click: Downloads Runner installer if not detected (or prompts to install), then downloads the tiny .agentforge file for this agent.
Goal: 80-90% of users choose this path.

Secondary Options (Smaller, Below)
"Run in Browser Now" → Opens the web agent chat tab immediately (no install).
Subtext: "Quick test – no download required"
"Download Python Package (Advanced)" → Current ZIP with run.sh / run.bat.
Subtext: "Requires Python installed – more steps"
(Make this smaller / grayed out to de-emphasize)

Small Help Text / Tooltip Nearby
"First time? Download AgentForge Runner once (takes ~1 minute). After that, double-click any agent file to chat instantly with your avatar!"


Step-by-Step User Flow (What the User Sees & Does)

User finishes building → sees success banner in builder window.
Clicks big blue "Download & Run on Desktop" button.
If Runner not installed (detect via browser check or just always offer):
Browser downloads Runner installer:
Mac: AgentForgeRunner-macOS.dmg or .app.zip
Windows: AgentForgeRunner-Windows.exe
Linux: .AppImage or .deb

Shows overlay/inline instructions:
"Step 1: Install AgentForge Runner (one-time)"
"Double-click the downloaded file and follow the prompts (like installing any app)."
Tiny progress spinner + "Installing… (this only happens once)"


After Runner installed (or if already installed):
Automatically downloads the agent file: MyWebDesigner.agentforge (~10-50 KB JSON bundle).
Shows message:
"Agent downloaded! Double-click MyWebDesigner.agentforge to open it"
Optional: "It should open automatically in AgentForge Runner."


User double-clicks the .agentforge file:
Runner launches (or brings window forward).
Small native-style window appears: avatar at top, chat history (if any), prompt field at bottom.
If model not connected: Runner shows native prompt "Connect Ollama or API key to start chatting" (same form as web).


What to Tell Your Devs (Copy-Paste Directive)
"Update the builder window (/builder) completion state:

After 'complete' step, show a centered success banner + big primary button:
'Download & Run on Desktop (Easiest)'
Subtext: 'Install AgentForge Runner once, then double-click any agent file'

On click:
Check if Runner is installed (optional via custom protocol handler like agentforge://check, or just always download installer first time).
Download Runner installer (.dmg / .exe / .AppImage) if needed.
Then download .agentforge file (JSON with config + avatar choice + prompt).

File association in Tauri:
Register .agentforge extension → open Runner app.
Runner loads config → opens avatar chat window immediately.

Fallbacks:
Secondary button: 'Run in Browser' (opens web agent tab).
Tertiary: 'Download Python ZIP' (keep for now, but smaller/less prominent).

Add inline help text: 'Runner install is one-time only. After that, agents open like any desktop app – no Terminal, no extra work.'

This makes desktop deployment truly dummy-proof: one install, then double-click forever."
This approach minimizes extra work — most users will install Runner once (guided), then future agents are effortless double-clicks. It matches how apps like Notion, Discord, or even some AI tools (e.g., local LLM frontends) work.
