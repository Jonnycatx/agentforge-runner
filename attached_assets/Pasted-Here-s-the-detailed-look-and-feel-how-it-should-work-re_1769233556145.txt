Here's the detailed look-and-feel + how it should work, refined for 2025/2026 best practices (minimalism, intuitive flows, agentic reliability, and browser-native execution).
Overall Design Philosophy

Apple-inspired minimalism — heavy whitespace, system fonts (Inter or SF Pro fallback), subtle blue accents (#2563EB or softer gradients), rounded corners, no visual noise.
Dark mode by default (auto-detect OS preference) with light toggle in header.
PWA installable — users get a "Add to Dock/Home Screen" prompt after first use → feels like a native app without being one.
Responsive: Full desktop split-views → mobile stacked chat + collapsible preview.
Performance first — fast loads (Next.js static/edge), lazy-loaded components, subtle micro-animations (Framer Motion fade-ins, typing indicators).

1. Builder Experience (The Main Web Portal – agentforge.com/builder)
This is where users conversationally create agents — the core "web agent" for building.
Layout & Visuals

Full-screen split-view (resizable divider like Cursor Composer):
Left side (45-50%): Conversational chat pane.
Top: Compact model selector (dropdown with icons: Ollama green dot for local, Groq lightning for speed, etc.) + current step indicator (e.g., "Goal → Personality").
Chat area: Clean bubbles (user right-aligned blue, builder left-aligned gray with cute bot avatar).
Bottom: Wide input field + send button (mic icon for voice-to-text via Web Speech API).
Subtle typing animation (three bouncing dots) when builder responds.

Right side (50-55%): Live preview pane with tabs:
"Config" tab: Readable JSON view (syntax-highlighted, copy button).
"Test Agent" tab: Mini chat window to instantly talk to the in-progress agent (real inference if model connected; simulated otherwise with banner "Connect model for live responses").
"Tools & Personality" tab: Visual chips/badges (e.g., 🔍 Web Search, 🖼️ Image Gen) that highlight as added.


Top global bar: Logo left, progress stepper center (Greeting → Goal → Personality → Tools → Model → Review → Complete), right side: Save, Export button (opens modal), theme toggle.
Empty state: Centered template gallery grid (12 cards with icons, descriptions, "Start with this" buttons) — prevents blank-page anxiety.

How It Works (Flow)

User lands → types natural prompt (e.g., "Build me a web design agent").
Builder Agent (your hardcoded expert prompt) guides step-by-step, one question at a time.
Real-time updates: As user replies, right pane auto-refreshes config/test chat.
Dummy-proof: Tooltips on hover, "Help" bubble for examples, undo button for steps.
Completion: Confetti animation + "Agent Ready!" banner → big "Run Now" / "Download" buttons.

2. Running the Agent in Browser (The "Web Agent" Chat Window)
This is the no-install runner — opens in a new tab or full-window mode when user chooses "Run in Browser" from export/deploy modal.
Layout & Visuals

Compact, focused window (or full-page takeover):
Header: Agent's chosen avatar (cute rounded image, 64px), name (e.g., "Web Designer Pro"), model badge (e.g., "Running on Groq Llama 3.1").
Main area: Scrollable chat history (bubbles same style as builder).
Bottom: Input field + send (mic for voice, file upload icon for tools like document analysis).
Optional floating controls: Minimize, always-on-top toggle, switch model.

Avatar enhancements: Simple CSS animation (gentle bob/idle), "thinking" state (pulsing glow or dots above head).
Tools integration: If agent has web search → shows inline "Searching..." spinner; results appear as cards in chat.
Mobile: Full-screen chat, keyboard-friendly.

How It Works

On "Run in Browser": Generate a self-contained page (static HTML/JS bundle via your export utils):
Uses LangChain.js (or simple custom chain) for agent logic.
Loads agent config from JSON (prompt, tools, personality).
Connects to user's model (API key from localStorage or prompt to enter).
For local Ollama: Proxy via browser fetch to localhost:11434 (warn if CORS issue).
First load: Small spinner "Loading agent..." (caches assets).

Inference: Streams responses (typing effect in chat).
Tools: Browser-native (fetch for search, File API for uploads, no native OS access).
Save state: LocalStorage persistence → reopen tab = continue conversation.
Exit: "Back to Builder" link or close tab.

This setup makes the web agent super easy: arrive → build → test instantly in browser → optionally download Runner for desktop avatar magic. No Python, no heavy installs for basic use.
If you want to prototype visuals, base it on Cursor's clean composer (split-view, minimal tabs) + Apple's product pages (big whitespace, focus on one CTA). I can suggest specific CSS tweaks or component names from shadcn/ui if needed.
